		<h2> Description </h2>
		<p> I absolutely dig Japanese cutlure. And I also like cooking, so when the
		two collide, my mind gives birth to something beautiful like the picture
		above.</p>
		<p> Preparation time: 20 minutes (if you also want to marinade your meat,
		take those hours into account) <br> Cooking time: 20 minutes </p>
		<h2> Ingredients </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> 400 grams of ramen noodles </li>
			<li> 4 pork chops or 4 chicken breasts </li>
			<li> Honey </li>
			<li> Soy sauce </li>
			<li> 3 garlic cloves </li>
			<li> Chinese 5 spices (if you happen to live in Russia, you can use
				<i>Kotanyi Азиатская кухня</i>) </li>
			<li> Hot chili pepper (as spices or fresh, kinda optional) </li>
			<li> 4 boiled eggs (optional) </li>
			<li> Worcestershire sauce (optional) </li>
			<li> Sweet corn (optional) </li>
			<li> Dried nori sheet (optional) </li>
			<li> Green onion (optional) </li>
		</ul>
		<h2> Steps </h2>
		<ol>
			<li> If you're going to marinade the meat, then use spices, garlic,
				ginger, soy sauce and honey for it. The trick here is to reuse the
				marinade for the broth later </li>
			<li> If you don't have time for the marinade, then just pour in
				everything I mentioned in the previous step into the kettle and
				bring it to the boil</li>
			<li> Add a pinch of sugar and more spices to taste </li>
			<li> While you wait for the spices in the broth to open up, start hard
				boiling some eggs </li>
			<li> Start frying the meat, around 5 minutes on each side </li>
			<li> Cook the noodles as per1 packet instructions </li>
			<li> Once noodles are ready, separate the noodles into 4 bowls evenly </li>
			<li> When the meat is cooked and eggs are boiled, start putting the
				broth, toppings, and meat into each bowl. The image above might help you </li>
